# HAP

HAP (formerly known as HMLP) is the biggest project I have made for now and its name stands for Help Alphabet Pronounciation. This is supposed to be a program to be used by me but I dont care if other people use it. Feel free to tell me any suggestion you have for the program.

For now the lanugages which you can check its alphabets are:
* Spanish
* Russian
* Greek
* Japanese (no Kanji, only its phonetic alphabets a.k.a. Hiragana and Katakana)
* Hebrew (no "Geresh" and "Vowel points")
* Toki Pona (And a dictionary!)
* Korean
* Arab (no vocals)
* Armenian
* Turkish
* Inuktitut
